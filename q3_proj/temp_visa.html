				<h3 class="left">Temporary Visas</h3>
				<p>
				Whether you have a loved one living in the US, have always wanted to try living or working in this country, or simply have financial interests
				that require you to stay in the country from time to time, you will need a temporary visa in order to legally stay here. Having an effective,
				insightful attorney to assist you with everything from the type of visa you need to keeping you informed of important paperwork to be filed and
				impending deadlines. To find out more information on how our Kansas employment visa attorney can assist you with your temporary visa, contact

				<h3 class="left">Employment Visas</h3>
				<p>
				A skilled immigration lawyer can assist you in obtaining your H-1b visa. This visa allows foreign nationals to work in professional level
				"specialty occupations" (requiring at least a bachelor's degree) in the United States. No matter what your chosen career
				- lawyer, accountant, architect, doctor, engineer, or religious worker - you must be able to prove that you have the proper educational
				background by providing proof of a bachelor's degree or the equivalent.

				will last for five years before you must renew your visa (those who apply within the US must reapply after two years). <br>
