<!-- Andrew Bae, 126019, AC56, I used BBEdit to create this and the resources I used were w3schools, stack overflow, geeksforgeeks, altcademy, and mozilla developer.
I also used bits of code from all of my past assignments in order to reduce work time but had to recode some of it because it wouldn't work for some reason. 
The images of the law office are from google. All the information is from her current website at https://wichitaimmigration.com/index.php The favicon is from google.
The stock free images are from pexels.
This is more of like a rough draft because I am not completely happy with how this looks right now. -->
