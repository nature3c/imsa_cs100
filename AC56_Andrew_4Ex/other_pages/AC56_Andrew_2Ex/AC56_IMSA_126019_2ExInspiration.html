			<p>  Dez Bryant is one of my biggest inspirations when it came to playing football. I remember<br>
				 first watching the Dallas Cowboys with one of my cousins from Texas and seeing this receiver<br>
				 catch every ball and lead the Cowboys to a playoff appearance in 2016. Desmond Bryant was<br>
				 born <b>November 4, 1988</b> in <b>Galveston Island,Texas</b>. He was a 4 star recruit in<br>
				 high-school and committed to play at <i>Oklahoma State University</i>. After his college<br>
				 football career he made the stretch to the NFL where he was drafted by the Cowboys and stayed<br>
				 there for most of his career. He had over <b>7500 recieving yards</b> in his 10 year career.
			</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>  I remember watching Bryant's highlights and seeing him catch these impossible balls.<br>
				 Watching him and Jason Witten were my biggest inspirations for getting into playing and watching<br>
				 football I watched him throughout elementary and middle school but was sad when he left and was<br>
				 replaced by Amari Cooper. I wanted to be like him so I started to play football more competitively.<br>
				 I joined my middle school football team and eventually my high school football team. I wanted to play<br>
				 like him but my lack of recieving skills led to to play linebacker and the line where I was better<br>
				 suited because I could hit people hard with the strength that I had.<br>
